Rule:
-self-contained module
    -everything to do with my module is in my module
    -no global variables
    -if a module manages more than one thing it should be split up
-separation of concerns
-DRY code:
-efficient DOM usage
    -very few $(selections)
-no memory leaks 
    -all eventsc can be unbound
